    "### About Cardinality and low_cardinality_cols code\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked chatGPT for detailed explanation about this code for my own reference(or maybe for you if anyone is reading this): \n",
    "\n",
    "The code you provided is typically used in machine learning for feature selection or preprocessing. It's specifically used to identify and select categorical columns with relatively low cardinality. Let's break down what this code does and why it's necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cardinality: In the context of machine learning, \"cardinality\" refers to the number of unique values in a categorical column. For example, in a \"color\" column, if there are only three unique values (\"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\"), the cardinality of that column is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical Columns: Categorical columns are those that contain discrete, non-numeric values. These values represent categories or labels, such as \"color,\" \"gender,\" or \"country.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low Cardinality: The code aims to identify categorical columns with relatively low cardinality. This is often done for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "    High cardinality categorical columns can lead to a large number of one-hot encoded features, which can significantly increase the dimensionality of your data and make the model more complex. It can also lead to sparse data, which may affect the model's performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Low cardinality columns are typically easier to work with because they have fewer unique categories, making them more manageable for feature engineering and modeling.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Selection: The code creates a list of column names (low_cardinality_cols) by iterating through the columns of the dataset X_train_full. It checks if the column's data type is \"object\" (indicating it's a categorical column) and if the number of unique values in that column is less than 10. If both conditions are met, the column name is added to the low_cardinality_cols list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting low_cardinality_cols list contains the names of categorical columns with low cardinality, which can then be used for various purposes in the machine learning workflow. For example, you might use these columns for one-hot encoding, label encoding, or as features for your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code helps you identify and select categorical columns with low cardinality, which is a common practice in machine learning to manage data complexity and improve model performance when dealing with categorical features."

    "By applying .astype(str) to the column names, you are explicitly converting any non-string column names into string data types. This can be helpful to ensure consistency in the data and prevent potential issues that might arise if you were to work with column names as non-string data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, having all column names as strings is a common convention, and it makes it easier to work with DataFrames and perform various operations, especially when you need to reference columns, filter data, or manipulate the DataFrame using column names as keys. The code you provided ensures that all columns are treated as strings, regardless of their original data type, which can help avoid unexpected errors or inconsistencies in your code."
